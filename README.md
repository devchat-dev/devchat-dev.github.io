The #devchat website.  

The backend consits of two Python "programs" which run on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/details/):  

1. [slack-invite](https://github.com/devolio-devchat/slack-invite) which handles the invites using the Slack API.  
2. [slack-members-stats](https://github.com/devolio-devchat/slack-members-stats) which returns the count of total members and how many are currently online.  

Contribution is welcome.
